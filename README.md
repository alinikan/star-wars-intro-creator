# Star Wars Intro Creator

This is a Python script that generates a video imitating the classic Star Wars intro sequence. It creates a scrolling text intro like the one seen in the Star Wars films, complete with the Star Wars logo and theme music.

The script uses `moviepy`, a Python library for video editing, to compose the final video.

A sample output of the script is included in this repository as `Star Wars Intro.mp4`. You can also watch the video from here:
